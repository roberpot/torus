// TODO: Also mix in thread synchronization policy here!
/// The ultimate template that defines a connection type
/** Combines connection_base (the highly complex class implementing essentially
 * all connection-related functionality) with a connection policy (a simpler
 * helper class determining the rules that govern the process of setting up the
 * underlying connection to the backend).
 *
 * The pattern used to combine these classes is the same as for
 * basic_transaction.  Through use of the template mechanism, the policy object
 * is embedded in the basic_connection object so that it does not need to be
 * allocated separately.  At the same time this construct avoids the need for
 * any virtual functions in this class, which reduces risks of bugs in
 * construction and destruction; as well as any need to templatize the larger
 * body of code in the connection_base class which might otherwise lead to
 * unacceptable code duplication.
